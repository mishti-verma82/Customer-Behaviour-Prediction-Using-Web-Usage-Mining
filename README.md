# Customer-Behaviour-Prediction-Using-Web-Usage-Mining
Machine learning project using web usage data for predicting customer behaviour.

📌 Overview Of The Project

Predict customer purchase intention by analyzing web usage patterns. Using session data and user interactions, machine learning models forecast whether a visitor is likely to make a purchase. This project applies Web Usage Mining and Machine Learning in e-commerce.

🎯 Problem Statement
